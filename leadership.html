                not only have I gained further understanding of the topics technically, I have 
                also learned to explain concepts in ways students can understand rather than how 
                I prefer to approach. More importantly, I have been fortunate to have incredible 
                mentors who have helped shaped my professional career, and I am grateful to be 
                able to pay it forward through teaching the next generation of engineers.</p>
