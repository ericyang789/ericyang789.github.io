    <h1> Teaching Assistantships </h1>
    <div class="experience">
        <div class="reflection">
            <p> During my time at the UW, I served as a teaching assistant in <i> Solid and Gel 
                Mechanics </i> and <i> Introduction to Engineering Design </i> courses. Through teaching, 
                not only have I gained further understanding of the topics technically, I have 
                also learned to explain concepts in ways students can understand rather than how 
                I prefer to approach. More importantly, I have been fortunate to have incredible 
                mentors who have helped shaped my professional career, and I am grateful to be 
                able to pay it forward through teaching the next generation of engineers.

            <p> Taking on one of the Grand Challenges in Global Health launched by the Bill & Melinda

            <p> Research has defined my undergraduate experience and I am constantly looking to encourage 
                students to find their passions through research. To do so, I served as an Undergraduate

        <div class="reflection">
            <p> Reflecting on my young scientific career, the biggest lesson I have learned is that if I 
                really aspire to serve the global community, I cannot do it alone. By integrating my 
                experiences with my leadership style, I constantly look to mentor the next generation 
                of talented difference-makers in carving their own paths. From inspiring future scientists 
                serving as an advisor for the
